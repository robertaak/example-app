This is my first project in Laravel - a simple blog site, where users can read blog posts, filter through categories, search for keywords, add comments to posts. Admins can post blog posts, edit and and delete them, and delete comments users left on posts. 
Framework: Laravel, db: MySQL. Front-end: Laravel Blade.
